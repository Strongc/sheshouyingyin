BACKGROUND:

The Table library is a generic open hash table with buckets and linked
lists.  It is pretty high performance and includes some interesting
functions such as the writing a table from memory to disk and then
reading it back again (however not in real time like gdbm).

You also can mmap a table directly from disk for high performance
access of read-only hash tables.  To get mmap functions you will need
to remove the NO_MMAP flag from the Makefile.  You may have the play
with the mmap defines to get it to compile on your system.

See the table_t.c file for usage examples and table.h for the function
prototypes and comments.  My apologies for the minimal documentation.

INSTALLATION:

1) Typing 'make' should be enough to build libtable.a and the
   table_util utility program.

2) Typing 'make tests' should make the table_t test program.

REPOSITORY:

The newest versions of the library are available on the web.
