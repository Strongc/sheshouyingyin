/*
 * int table_insert_kd
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Like table_insert except it passes back a pointer to the key and
 * the data buffers after they have been inserted into the table
 * structure.
 *
 * This routine adds a key/data pair both of which are made up of a
 * buffer of bytes and an associated size.  Both the key and the data
 * will be copied into buffers allocated inside the table.  If the key
 * exists already, the associated data will be replaced if the
 * overwrite flag is set, otherwise an error is returned.
 *
 * NOTE: be very careful changing the values since the table library
 * provides the pointers to its memory.  The key can _never_ be
 * changed otherwise you will not find it again.  The data can be
 * changed but its length can never be altered unless you delete and
 * re-insert it into the table.
 *
 * WARNING: The pointers to the key and data are not in any specific
 * alignment.  Accessing the key and/or data as an short, integer, or
 * long pointer directly can cause problems.
 *
 * WARNING: Replacing a data cell (not inserting) will cause the table
 * linked list to be temporarily invalid.  Care must be taken with
 * multiple threaded programs which are relying on the first/next
 * linked list to be always valid.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 *
 * Success - TABLE_ERROR_NONE
 *
 * Failure - Table error code.
 *
 * ARGUMENTS:
 *
 * table_p - Table structure pointer into which we will be inserting a
 * new key/data pair.
 *
 * key_buf - Buffer of bytes of the key that we are inserting.  If you
 * are storing an (int) as the key (for example) then key_buf should
 * be a (int *).
 *
 * key_size - Size of the key_buf buffer.  If set to < 0 then the
 * library will do a strlen of key_buf and add 1 for the '\0'.  If you
 * are storing an (int) as the key (for example) then key_size should
 * be sizeof(int).
 *
 * data_buf - Buffer of bytes of the data that we are inserting.  If
 * it is NULL then the library will allocate space for the data in the
 * table without copying in any information.  If data_buf is NULL and
 * data_size is 0 then the library will associate a NULL data pointer
 * with the key.  If you are storing a (long) as the data (for
 * example) then data_buf should be a (long *).
 *

 * library will do a strlen of data_buf and add 1 for the '\0'.  If

 * should be sizeof(long).
 *
 * key_buf_p - Pointer which, if not NULL, will be set to the address
 * of the key storage that was allocated in the table.  If you are
 * storing an (int) as the key (for example) then key_buf_p should be
 * (int **) i.e. the address of a (int *).
